# NidraS:
The angel above you, looking after your dreams on the road.

NidraS is a sophisticated in-vehicle detection system leveraging recurrent neural networks, sensory fusion detection model and real-time monitoring. This multifaceted approach aims to identify subtle signs of drowsy driving thereby enhancing overall vehicle safety and lowering the risks associated with driver fatigue.

# Features: 
The model uses real time tracking to gather data from various data points like eye movements, change in pressure applied on steering wheel, drift while changing lanes and other such physiological signs. Observing unusual behaviour in these fields results in the model to prompt a voice alert to the driver. If the driver fails to respond to the voice alert then, appropriate action is taken to ensure the driverâ€™s safety.

# Impact:
NidraS aims to significantly reduce accidents caused by drowsy driving, thereby enhancing road safety.
